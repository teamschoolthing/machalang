# machaLang

The best programming language in the world.

Example Code: 
```java
hi macha
eduthuko macha a = 2
eduthuko macha b = 3

ippo macha (a+b==5) {
    padi macha "5 is the answer"
} illana macha {
    padi macha "5 is not the answer"
}
bye macha
```

## Run Code
First create a file or directly change index.macha in this machaLang folder. To run the file, enter into the terminal:
```
node index.js test.macha
```

## Manipulating Syntax
If you want to change the machaLang syntax, just change syntax.json and run the code in the same way shown in the previous section.
